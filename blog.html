	<li>9/14/23 - Journeys progress update - Development is reaching the late stages. Quest progression is nearly done, and the modlist is almost finalized. I may still modify it but this is a stable point to jump in. I also made the decision to add some endgame content myself, which was a contributing factor to some delays, but I hope it will be good enough to satisfy. The pack currently has ~470 quests. This is my first pack of this scale, and I am glad to see it coming together. Stay tuned for a beta announcement soon. Also, keep in mind this will be a beta, and not the finished product. Feel free to report any issues so I can solve them before the full release.</li>
	<li>5/11/23 - Formally announcing Minecraft Journeys! Journeys is going to be a 1.20 questing pack. No release date yet, but once 1.20 comes out it will be a matter of time.
        <li>1/23/23 - Stay tuned for a new pack soon. Additionally, for you bedrock fans, I may have something for you soon. I will announce any updates here.</li>
