      URGENT- CurseForge has been compromised. Do not download ANYTHING from it until the coast is clear. Monitor the status <a href="https://hackmd.io/B46EYzKXSfWSF35DeCZz9A">here.</a>

        Using my packs
      </h1>
      To use the packs on the site, it's fairly simple.
      Prism Launcher/MultiMC (recommended):
      This way is slightly harder than Curseforge, but you get a better launcher.
      Click on "Add Instance"
      Then, click on your pack website of choice. I recommend Modrinth (not available for legacy packs), but you can use Curseforge as well.
      Finally, search for the pack and install it.
      Curseforge:
      For the Curseforge app, its very easy. Simply go to search and type in the name of the pack, or just click install in the website.
      From here, packs should be playable. You can find my packs on the packs page.

      Lemme know if you want Technic or ATLauncher support.
      Inquiries about PolyMC WILL NOT BE ANSWERED. If you know why and disagree with it, you can feel free to leave this website. Hate through email will not change my opinion.
      <h1>
        Optimization
      </h1>
      A lot of my packs are fairly heavy so I attempt to optimize them as much as possible. However, it's not always enough, especially on some older hardware. I'm not here to judge, I am here to help you have fun.
      First, you will want to be using GraalVM. Graal is an optimized JVM for performance, and there is no real drawbacks to using it. While oracle or openjdk are functional, they can be fairly slow so a faster JVM will go a long way. If this sounds like technical jargon, don't worry. I will link a version of Graal on my pack pages.
      Second, you want to allocate about half of your system memory on low memory machines. 8gb machines will have a hard time but should be able to handle lower end packs. I will indicate if it performs well when limited on pack pages.
      Third, mess with your video settings. For some this may seem obvious, but if it does not don't worry. I install Jellysquid's Sodium in all of my fabric packs, which does help the process a bit, and sometimes tells you which settings matter most.
      Finally, CLOSE YOUR INTERNET BROWSER IF YOU HAVE ISSUES. Some browsers hog resources, especially Chrome. If you want more headroom, switch to Firefox or Vivaldi or something. Just not Chrome. If Discord gives you issues try opening it in a browser tab instead of the app, or just use it on your phone.
      <h1>
        Servers
      </h1>
      I do not host public servers, though with demand I may change that. For now, you will have to find a way.
      The easy way is to use a vps which supports importing packs. I used to use Sparked Host for that, and only stopped because I selfhost now. You could also use something like Oracle free tier or Linode for a cheaper option, but requiring more knowledge. Oracle is a pain in the *ss sometimes though, so if going this route Linode is a good way. However, you can also selfhost. This requires the following - Good internet, a router you have access to the config page of, a computer capable of running the server (usually needs same specs as just running the pack, also keep in mind if you play at the same time you could have performance issues if on the same machine.), and either a domain name or friends you can trust not to use your ip address for malicious purposes. There are plenty of guides on how to do this so I won't bother here.
      If selfhosting on a lower end machine, I recommend a skyblock or vanilla+ experience. I do not have those at the moment though, so I recommend Project Ozone 2 or tossing a couple mods you like together for vanilla+.
