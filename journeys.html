			Minecraft Journeys - Out Now!
		</h1>
		<a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/mc-journeys"> Download on Modrinth! </a>
		Journeys is a questing pack for 1.20. It features a decently sized questbook, custom rewards, and even some fun easter eggs hidden in the quest rewards. Download  <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/n6fsnux88gawht0/MC+Journeys-0.4A.zip/file"> here! </a> Just keep in mind this is a Curseforge export, but it will work with Prism Launcher and should work in MultiMC.
		Update 9/14/23 - Well, so much for not waiting another few months. The scope of the pack has increased a bit, and I was waiting on a few mods to get ported. I am currently gearing up for a beta release in the next few weeks, maybe even days. Stay tuned.
		Update 10/6/23 - Out now in Alpha! Since I wasnt gonna have the endgame content ready, I elected to launch an alpha so as to not keep you waiting. Have fun!
