		Journeys is a questing pack for 1.20. It features a decently sized questbook, custom rewards, and even some fun easter eggs hidden in the quest rewards. Download  <a href="https://fastupload.io/kyGExg14joNP/2hsv3KJ0rbbq3Fi/gXeGObp0azAa7/MC%20Journeys%200.7A.zip"> here! </a>
		Update 9/14/23 - Well, so much for not waiting another few months. The scope of the pack has increased a bit, and I was waiting on a few mods to get ported. I am currently gearing up for a beta release in the next few weeks, maybe even days. Stay tuned.
		Update 10/6/23 - Out now in Alpha! Since I wasnt gonna have the endgame content ready, I elected to launch an alpha so as to not keep you waiting. Have fun!
		Update 10/11/23 - After a few days of trying, it looks like curseforge will not be allowing my pack. I can modify it to meet their requirements but this would require removing mods, and since they can't give me a straight answer on what I need to do without days of waiting even with those modifications I would still likely be waiting. So here's my compromise - I just shipped an initial technic version, and I am prepared to ship on other launchers on request. The build here will no longer be a curseforge build, but instead the technic build, as they use a standard structure compatible with most launchers. Please send me an email to request support for a launcher.
