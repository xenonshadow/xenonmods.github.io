            <description>Development is reaching the late stages. Quest progression is nearly done, and the modlist is almost finalized. I may still modify it but this is a stable point to jump in. I also made the decision to add some endgame content myself, which was a contributing factor to some delays, but I hope it will be good enough to satisfy. The pack currently has ~470 quests. This is my first pack of this scale, and I am glad to see it coming together. Stay tuned for a beta announcement soon. Also, keep in mind this will be a beta, and not the finished product. Feel free to report any issues so I can solve them before the full release. Also, new pack icon, made by a friend.</description>
